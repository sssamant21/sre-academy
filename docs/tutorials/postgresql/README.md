# PostgreSQL Practical Tutorial & Production Labs

## Purpose

This tutorial is an operations-first, hands-on PostgreSQL learning track for DBA, DBRE, SRE, platform, and application engineers. It complements the PostgreSQL SRE/DBRE handbook by focusing on building, breaking, diagnosing, automating, recovering, and operating PostgreSQL systems.
